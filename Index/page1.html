	Back then, the NBA was dominated by big men ruling in the paint, now the NBA has shifted to a more guard dominated league ever since <a class="a" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry" target="_blank">Stephen Curry</a> had shot a lot of threes. Other teams realized that 3 points were way better that mid-range shots, so they also implemented 3 point shooting into their repitoire.
